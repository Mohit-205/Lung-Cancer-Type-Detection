# Lung-Cancer-Type-Detection
This repository contains a MATLAB app for detecting the type of lung cancer based on images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The application uses a dataset of lung cancer images, trains a deep learning model, and then uses that model to classify lung cancer types when provided with a new image.
